# Lost-Found-campus-portal
Find whatâ€™s lost, return whatâ€™s found. I built this Lost &amp; Found Campus Portal using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” a simple web app to help students quickly report and recover lost belongings.

ðŸ“– Problem

Students often lose important items like ID cards, wallets, or gadgets on campus.

No central platform exists to report or search lost/found items.

Current methods (posters, word-of-mouth, WhatsApp groups) are inefficient.

ðŸ’¡ Solution

A simple web-based portal where:

Students can report lost items.

Students can report found items.

All items are displayed in a searchable, filterable list.

Works on any device and stores data in LocalStorage (no backend needed).
